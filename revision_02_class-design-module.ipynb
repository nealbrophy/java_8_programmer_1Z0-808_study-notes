    "## Casting an object to it's parent-class type doesn't change the object's type (just the reference type)\n",
    "If you have two classes, *Parent* and *Child*, and *Child* overrides a method inherited from *Parent*, calling that method from a Child object which has been cast as a Parent reference type will still output the Child version of the method.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you cast the *Child* object and assign to a *Parent* reference you don't actually change the type of the object, you just tell Java you want to treat it like a *Parent* object. However, the internal implementation of the object remains intact. So Java will look at the reference and check if the method you're trying to call exists in the parent, it does so it allows the object to execute the method, but the object's version of the method is still the overridden one."
