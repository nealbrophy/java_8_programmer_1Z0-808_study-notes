    "# Inheritance in Java\n",
    "*Inheritance* is the process by which sub/child-classes can inherit existing fields/variables/methods from it's super/parent-class. Java supports *single-inheritance* meaning a class may inherit from only __ONE__ direct parent. However you can have multiple levels of inheritance such as class A extending class B which in turn extends class C.\n",
    "\n",
    "At it's most basic the concept of inheritance is often described as being an *'is a'* relationship: \n",
    "- *a car __is a__ motor vehicle* thus it would be appropriate for a *car* class to inherit from *motor vehicle* parent class\n",
    "- *a bear __is a__ mammal* thus it would be appropriate for a *bear* class to be a child of a *mammal* class\n",
    "- *a human __is NOT an__ island* therefore it would not make sense to have a *human* class as a child of an *island* class"

    "## Extending a class\n",
    "If you write a class which doesn't explicitly extend another class Java will automatically set your class to be a child of the top-level `java.lang.Object` class. So if you define a class like `public class MyClass {}` Java will automatically insert `extends java.lang.Object` at compile time. However, since `Object` is the top-most class essentially all classes inherit from it even if just indirectly.\n",

    "### Polymorphic parameters\n",
    "One common use of polymorphism, is defining functions which accept an instance of an interface to which you can then pass any class that implements the interface (as that would be casting from subtype, the class that implements the interface, to supertype, the insterface itself).\n",
    "\n",
    "__NOTE__: When defining a method which takes polymorphic parameters that will be accessible outside the class it's defined in (either via subclasses or objects), it is considered good practice to use the superclass or interface type as the input parameters. This potentially allows the method to be reused/repurposed more easily because it can accept a wider range of argument types. For example, you might use the `List` interface as a parameter rather than the `ArrayList` class which implements `List` that way the method can accept both `List` and any class which implements it (not just `ArrayList` and it's children)."
