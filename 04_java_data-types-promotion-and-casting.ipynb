    "`short myShort = myByte;`\n",

    "`int myInt = 32;`\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "`float myFloat = myInt;`\n",
    "\n",
    "Something to keep in mind is that since Java assumes any integral literal to be an `int`, that if you declare a `long` variable and don't put an `L` at the end of the literal, what you're actually doing is assigning an `int` literal to a `double` variable and Java will automatically promote it as such.\n",
    "\n",
    "**CAUTION**: Keep the ranges of types in mind when doing large sums, as if the result of an sum exceeds the maximum value allowed by the type, the value will be warped. If you need to, for example, multiply two large `int`s and there's a risk that the result will exceed the max value of `int` type, you can make one of the `int`s a `long` and Java will make sure the result is a `long`."

    "- Most operations result in `int` or `long`\n",
    "    - `byte`, `char`, and `short` values are automatically promoted to `int` prior to an operation\n",
    "    - If an expression contains a `long`, the entire expression is promoted to `long`\n",

    "One issue you can run into with automatic promotion is if you try to assign the result of a, for example, `short` operation to a `short` variable. Since Java automatically promotes the `shorts` to `int` before completing the operation, you are essentially trying to assigne an `int` to a `float` and Java will throw a compiler error."
