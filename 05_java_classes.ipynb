    "## The basic structure of a Java class\n",
    "The structure of a class is commonly as follows:\n",
    "- Package statement: e.g. `package myJavaFiles.myClasses;`\n",
    "    - The package statement is optional but recommended and is essentially the path to the class you're defining. For example if I create a *Hello* class in a directory *myJavaFiles/myClasses* the package statement might be as above. If present, the package statement must be the first line in your file.\n",
    "- Import statement: e.g. `import myJavaFiles.myClasses.FirstClass;`\n",
    "    - The import statement allows you to import any classes, variables, or functions from other packages/classes which you intend to use in the class you're defining. If present, import statements must be placed before your class in the file.\n",
    "- Public class declaration: e.g. `public class FirstClass {}`\n",
    "    - The public class is normally the primary class you're defining in your file (your class file can contain multiple classes but only one *public* class) and the name of your file should match your public class. For example if my class is named `FirstClass` as above then my file name has to be `FirstClass.java`.\n",
    "- Variable: e.g. `String myStringVar`, `int myInt = 1` etc\n",
    "    - Variables (sometimes called \"fields\") are the holders of information within your class. Variables often describe the state or attributes of your class.\n",
    "- Constructor(s): e.g. `public FirstClass() {}`\n",
    "    - Constructors are methods which are called at the time of object instantiation. The format for a constructor is to use the same name as the class it belongs to, followed by parentheses. If you don't define a constructor the default constructor will be used. If you do define a constructor, then the default constructor will be overwritten.\n",
    "- Methods: e.g. `public String myStringReturner() {}`, `public static void main(String [] args){}`\n",
    "    - Methods are the functions which reside in your class. If variables describe the state of your class/objects, then methods are the actions that your class/objects can perform."
