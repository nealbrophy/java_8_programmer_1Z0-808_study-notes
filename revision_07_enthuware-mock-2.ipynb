    "## If a constructor makes use of a static or instance variable which hasn't yet been initialized, the default value will be used\n",
    "This sounds pretty straightforward but is easy to overlook when dealing with multiple classes. First, imagine we have class *One* and class *Two* where *Two* extends *One* and overrides a method within. Now let's say that *One*'s constructor includes a call to the method that's been overridden AND that the overridden method makes use of an instance variable from *Two*. So, we know from the example above that if we instantiate an object of *Two* there will be an implicit call to `super()` and the overridden method will be used but what's easy to overlook is that even though this is being triggered by instantiation of an object of type *Two*, execution hasn't actually gotten to *Two* yet (it's still within the call to `super()` i.e. *One*'s constructor). Since no instance of *Two* exists yet, no instance variables have been initialized and thus the default value for whatever type of variable it is (i.e. `0` for an int, `null` for an Object etc) will be used."
