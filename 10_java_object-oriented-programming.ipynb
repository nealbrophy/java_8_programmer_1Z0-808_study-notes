    "# Object Oriented Programming\n",
    "## What is object oriented programming?\n",
    "OOP is a programming method that tries to model software on real world objects and their interactions. As such a fundamental aspect of OOP is the creation of objects which contain fields/variables and functions/methods. In order to create objects you first need a class which will act as the blueprint or recipe for the object. A class is essentially a reusable set of instructions for the creation of objects. For example, in pseudo-code it might look something like this:\n",
    "- create a `Shoes` class:\n",
    "    - class takes `shoeType`, `size`, `brand`, `color`, and `price` parameters\n",
    "    - creates an instance (an object) of type `Shoe` and assigns the `shoeType`, `size`, `brand`, `color`, and `price` properties for that specific instance\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "- create object `expensivePurpleShoes` which is an instance of `Shoes` and has the properties:\n",
    "    - `shoeType=\"dress\"`\n",
    "    - `size=8`\n",
    "    - `brand=\"Luxury Max\"`\n",
    "    - `color=\"purple\"`\n",
    "    - `price=2000`\n",
    "    \n",
    "As Java is at its core an Object Oriented language, all classes inherit from Java's base `java.lang.Object` class. Even if a class doesn't directly inherit from *Object*, at some point in its history a parent class will. For example, take the `java.util.ArrayList` class which has a family tree like this:\n",
    "<br><br>`java.lang.Object\n",
    "    |__java.util.AbstractCollection\n",
    "            |__java.util.AbstractList\n",
    "                    |__java.util.ArrayList\n",

    "## Benefits of OOP\n",
    "Some of the key benefits of OOP are:\n",
    "1. __Modularity__: self-contained bundles of code (objects/classes/packages) which can be imported and exported as needed\n",
    "2. __Information hiding__: the ability to have fields and methods within a class/object which cannot be directly accessed\n",
    "3. __Code re-use__: the modularity and atomic nature of OOP code encourages code re-use\n",
    "4. __Improved debugging and testing__: since one of the focuses of OOP is modularity, the goal is to hack self contained bundles of code with a very specific purpose and thus more specific errors\n",
    "5. __Popularity__: some other popular languages that use OOP are C#, F#, C++, Perl, Python"

    "- __Classes__: the blueprints which tell Java how to create an object of that class\n",
    "- __Abstraction__: the creation of classes from *less specific* to *more specific* e.g. a Clothes class which is a parent of a MensClothes class which is a parent of a MensShirts class\n",
    "- __Polymorphism__: the ability of child classes to inherit and change variables & methods from a parent class\n",
    "- __Inheritance__: the passing down of variables & methods from parent class to child class\n",
